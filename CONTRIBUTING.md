# Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Not just to the code, but also better documentation would also be appreciated; shortcuts signing is highly undocumented and TBH I'm not sure how to say exactly some of the things I know about it...

Minor contributions will also be appriecated. The codebase is kind of a mess right now, so contributions that don't change code but rather make it more readable are welcome.
